# Note..

This project is one of the learning materials that I use in implementing the sklearn pipeline library. The implicit goal of this project is to use pipelines in code efficiency to achieve solutions based on existing business problems.

Other things related to it such as the classification and clustering models used can certainly be changed or added to find the best model.
